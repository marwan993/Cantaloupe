                                    LOS ANGELES—The annual Electronic Entertainment Expo was called off Tuesday after its organizers discovered the immersive
                                    power of literature, reportedly realizing that no video game could ever compare to the
                                    wonder of opening a work by Leo Tolstoy or Jorge Luis Borges and becoming engrossed in
                                    a masterful volume of fiction. “After learning how poorly video games fare alongside
                                    the rich explorations of the human condition contained in novels such as Mrs. Dalloway
                                    and Moby Dick, we have concluded it is best to cancel E3,” said Electronic Software Association
                                    CEO Michael Gallagher, clutching a copy of One Hundred Years Of Solitude as he observed
                                    that mere pixels on a screen could ever engage one’s imagination as fully as the majestic
                                    sweep of Gabriel García Márquez’s magic realism prose.

                                    Netflix representative Tina Komal spoke in defense of a recent episode of ‘Queer Eye’
                                    wherein the the Fab Five were forced to euthanize a contestant who was a completely hopeless

                                    ultimately deemed the only practical option for improving his life,” said Komal in a
                                    stirring defense of the episode where, after futilely encouraging the unemployed Tim

                                    mango salsa recipe to shake up his carb-heavy diet, the Fab Five solemnly led Yonkers
                                    out to his re-landscaped backyard to be mercy-killed with a single gunshot to the head
                                    by grooming guru Jonathan Van Ness.

                    <p>It’s undeniably wack that the Warriors, with the signing of DeMarcus Cousins to a one-year, $5.3 million

                        signing a little stranger than, for example, Kevin Durant’s move to Golden State, is that—by Cousins’s
