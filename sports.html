                                        MOSCOW—Lamenting that his fitness goals would now be thrown off for the rest of the World Cup, Argentinian forward Lionel
                                        Messi was reportedly pissed off Saturday after forgetting to wear his Fitbit watch
                                        during a group stage match against Iceland. “Shit. Of course the one time I leave
                                        it in the locker room,
                                        <br> I go out there and run, like, 10,000 steps,” said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner,
                                        adding that failing to log his activity stung even harder because he was merely 800
                                        steps away from earning Fitbit’s “Ruby Slippers” badge, which he’d been attempting
                                        to earn throughout Argentina’s warm-up matches. “Ugh, now I’m going to have this
                                        weird dip in my activity, and my World Cup weight goal is totally going to be messed
                                        up. And I just know Sergio [Agüero] is going to rub it in my face—he was running
                                        like a mad man out there; there’s no way he didn’t beat my step record.” At press
                                        time, team sources confirmed Messi had since placed his Fitbit back on his wrist
                                        and was doing laps around Spartak Stadium to rack up extra miles.

                                        <br> The 26-year-old’s dramatics in the 2-0 win against Mexico drew criticism when he
                                        rolled around on the floor and screamed in apparent agony after Miguel Layun placed
                                        the top of his boot on his ankle. “I just feel the pain,” Neymar said. “It’s complicated.
                                        It’s not something I can control.” “I got stepped on unfairly,” he added. “I think
                                        it was off the ball, outside the game. I don’t think it should be done. “But that’s
                                        the thing, they talked too much before the game – and now they’re going home.” Well,

                                    <p>This will likely go down as the worst goal celebration at the World Cup. Belgium's Adnan
                                        Januzaj scored a beautiful second-half goal in its match against England on Thursday,
                                        and it fired up Januzaj's teammate Michy Batshuayi. Batshuayi grabbed the ball and
                                        intended to drop kick it into the net or possibly into the stands.

                        <p>There is no fan community in American sports that thinks more about how it does what it does than
                            NBA fans. This isn’t necessarily a compliment, but it’s not really up for debate, either. The
                            NBA is the best and most interesting league that we’ve got, and as such is pretty excellent to
                            get excited or upset about in various ways. Over the last few years, the game has evolved into
                            something more protean and open than ever before while simultaneously being tamed by the bloodless
                            beauty of the Golden State juggernaut, and as a result the fan discourse has turned inwards—away
                            from the old soaring jazzwad aesthetic parsings of a few years ago and toward a kind of technocratic
                            futurism and more recently, as Golden State has cemented itself as both the present and the near
                            future, in some more grim existential directions.</p>

                        <p>It’s undeniably wack that the Warriors, with the signing of DeMarcus Cousins to a one-year, $5.3
                            million deal on Monday night, have managed to assemble an entire starting five that, when healthy,
                            could run the Eastern Conference All-Stars off the court. But what makes the earthquake of the
                            Cousins signing a little stranger than, for example, Kevin Durant’s move to Golden State, is
                            that—by Cousins’s account at least—no other teams were willing to make him an offer.</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/danG.webp" alt="">
                        <p>A lot has changed in the eight(!) years since LeBron James left the Cavaliers for the first time.
                            The huge production of the The Decision was replaced with a grammatically suspect tweet. Cleveland
                            has a championship. And Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, it seems, has grown out of Comic Sans. With James
                            heading to the Lakers, all eyes were on Gilbert to see if another tantrum was in the offing.
                            James, after all, said he still thinks about that 2010 letter. But bygones are apparently bygones,
                            and Gilbert’s letter, released by the Cavs last night, is alternately fond, sentimental, and
                            grateful. It also promises the eventual retirement of James’s No. 23.</p>
