                        cunning</h2>

                    <p>CHICAGO—Resigning himself to the notion that he might never match them for sheer drive, local man Trevor
                        Henning came to the realization Thursday that he would always be up against smarter, faster, and
                        more cunning apartment hunters. “I wonder if there’s a point to even trying when there are people
                        who basically specialize at this,” said Henning, reflecting upon the handful of suitable apartments
                        within his price range that he’d seen online but failed to actually view before they were snatched
                        up by savvier, more predatory renters. “There will always be someone 10 steps ahead of me. I can
                        call to see an apartment the same day I learn about it and show up just in time to see them signing
                        the lease. By the time I’m just coming around to the idea of having radiator heat, they’re halfway
                        done repainting the bathroom. Maybe I’m just not cut out to find a good apartment.” At press time,
                        Henning had put down a three-month deposit to sublet the second bedroom in a garden unit $200 over
                        his price range.</p>

                        <p>SOUTH Dallas, TX—Saying the bustling scene looked like a veritable “blowout” for the six-limbed insects,
                            local sources confirmed Tuesday that a group of ants were having some kind of wild party inside a
                            crack in the pavement. “Wow, those ants look like they must be having a total blast in there,” said
                            Sam Pendleton, a witness to the festivities, explaining that the ants were pouring in from all corners
                            of the sidewalk to “party down” in the recess, with many bringing tiny crumbs to provide nourishment
                            for the all-out bash. “It looks like there must be hundreds of them down there crawling all over
                            each other and just going fucking nuts. Plus, there’s a line of ants stretching all the way to the
                            curb just waiting to get inside the crack. This rager is clearly just getting started.” Pendleton
                            later went on to admit that he wished he could get down there and join the party himself.
